# Mice Behavior Prediction Project

#### Abstract
#### Behavioral decisions can arise from a multitude of factors: sensory information, stimuli, reward, punishment. It is unknown which specific neuron activity in the brain pertains to action selection, however there are known correlations between specific brain areas and actions. Steinmetz explored these decisions in mice and their resulting neural activity. Using unsupervised learning and a subset of his results, similar neuron activity was explored to locate possible brain regions. A successful model was built with the resulting 4 brain regions to predict the behavioral decisions of the mice. With the model, a possible correlation between neuron activity in different brain regions and action selection emerged and is a hint to the conclusion of global neural correlates of action selection.
